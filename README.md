# Py:1 Fullname printer.

This Python code is a simple program that prompts the user to enter their **first name, middle name, and last name**. It uses the **input** function to take user input and assigns each input to variables fname, mname, and lname respectively.

Then, it prints a message that concatenates these variables to form the user's full name. The **print** statement uses string concatenation with the **+** operator to combine the first name, middle name, and last name with spaces in between.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

**fname = input("What's your first name?\n")**: This line prompts the user to enter their first name and stores the input in the variable fname.

**mname = input("What's your middle name?\n")**: This line prompts the user to enter their middle name and stores the input in the variable mname.

**lname = input("What's your last name?\n")**: This line prompts the user to enter their last name and stores the input in the variable lname.

**print("Your full name is "+ fname + " " + mname + " " + lname)**: This line prints the user's full name by concatenating the variables fname, mname, and lname with spaces in between.

The **\n** in the input prompts is used to add a newline character, creating a new line for each prompt to make the interaction more readable in the console.
